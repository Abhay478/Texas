//!
//! Well, hello there.
//! 
//! So this crate aims to provide convenient ways of programmatically generating a latex file.
//! 
//! If you want to just convert from some other file format WITHOUT any processing, I recommend `pandoc`.
//! 
//! I'll slowly and steadily begin adding more features, and my goal is to be able to cover most standard use-cases of Latex.
//! If you want any feature, raise an issue! I will see it, and while I may not reply (scatterbrained, much?) I will fix it.
//! 
//! A shout-out to another crate, `tex-rs`. A few of the design choices I made are based on this crate.
//! Mine's still better, though. ðŸ˜‰
//!
